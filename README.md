# ECO-DISSOLVE - Revolutionary Chemical Plastic Recycling for Environmental Restoration  🌍
#### **Team:** DeshSwadesh 
#### **Problem statement title:** Real life solutions for Waste Management
#### **Theme:** Clean & Green Technology


## 🚀 Overview  
ECO-DISSOLVE is a **Waste to Wealth innovation** that goes beyond traditional recycling. Instead of simply reshaping plastics, our solution **chemically dissolves plastic waste into harmless compounds and reusable resources**, permanently removing it from the waste loop while creating new value streams.  



## 🌱 Problem Statement  
India generates over 26,000 tonnes of plastic waste daily, yet only about 9% is recycled, often downcycled into low-grade products like PVC. The rest largely ends up in landfills, incinerators, or the open environment, where it persists for centuries, polluting soil, water, and air. Conventional recycling merely changes plastic’s form without solving the root problem, creating an urgent need for a sustainable, circular solution.


## 💡 Our Solution – Turning Waste into Wealth  
- **Innovative chemical dissolution** using eco-friendly solvents  
- **High-value by-products** recovered for renewable applications  
- **Permanent elimination** of harmful plastic waste  
- **Circular economy approach** to transform waste into usable wealth  



## ⚙️ How It Works  
1. **Collection & Sorting** – Waste streams gathered and pre-sorted  
2. **Dissolution Bath** – Application of ECO-DISSOLVE solution at room temperature  
3. **Decomposition** – Plastics broken down at the molecular level  
4. **Resource Recovery** – Safe by-products reused as raw material for industry  



## 🌍 Impact & Benefits  
- **Environmental:** Cleaner oceans, reduced landfill pressure, lower carbon footprint  
- **Economic:** Converts plastic waste into **valuable raw materials** for industries  
- **Social:** Supports sustainable livelihoods & community-driven waste management  
- **Sustainability:** Promotes a **Waste to Wealth** circular economy model  


## 📌 Future Scope  
- Industrial-scale deployment for large waste streams  
- IoT-based real-time monitoring of waste conversion  
- Government & industry partnerships to expand **Waste to Wealth** initiatives
