# ECO-DISSOLVE - Revolutionary Chemical Plastic Recycling for Environmental Restoration  üåç
#### **Team:** DeshSwadesh 
#### **Problem statement title:** Real life solutions for Waste Management
#### **Theme:** Clean & Green Technology


## üöÄ Overview  
ECO-DISSOLVE is a **Waste to Wealth innovation** that goes beyond traditional recycling. Instead of simply reshaping plastics, our solution **chemically dissolves plastic waste into harmless compounds and reusable resources**, permanently removing it from the waste loop while creating new value streams.  



## üå± Problem Statement  
India generates over 26,000 tonnes of plastic waste daily, yet only about 9% is recycled, often downcycled into low-grade products like PVC. The rest largely ends up in landfills, incinerators, or the open environment, where it persists for centuries, polluting soil, water, and air. Conventional recycling merely changes plastic‚Äôs form without solving the root problem, creating an urgent need for a sustainable, circular solution.


## üí° Our Solution ‚Äì Turning Waste into Wealth  
- **Innovative chemical dissolution** using eco-friendly solvents  
- **High-value by-products** recovered for renewable applications  
- **Permanent elimination** of harmful plastic waste  
- **Circular economy approach** to transform waste into usable wealth  



## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works  
- **Collection & Segregation** : Plastics are collected through community cooperatives and app-based incentives, with basic sorting at the source.  
- **Bio-Dissolution Bath**  : Mixed and contaminated plastics are immersed in biocompatible solvents (ethylenediamine, propanediamine) at room temperature, avoiding high energy consumption.  
- **Enzyme-Assisted Depolymerization**  : Engineered enzymes selectively depolymerize plastics into their original monomer building blocks.  
- **Monomer Recovery & Reuse**  : Purified monomers are extracted and supplied back as feedstock for manufacturing high-quality plastics and other industrial applications.  
- **AI + IoT Optimization**  : Sensors and AI models continuously track process efficiency, safety, and recovery rates to enable large-scale scalability.  


## üåç Impact & Benefits  
- **Environmental:** Cleaner oceans, reduced landfill pressure, lower carbon footprint  
- **Economic:** Converts plastic waste into **valuable raw materials** for industries  
- **Social:** Supports sustainable livelihoods & community-driven waste management  
- **Sustainability:** Promotes a **Waste to Wealth** circular economy model  


## üìå Future Scope  
- Industrial-scale deployment for large waste streams  
- IoT-based real-time monitoring of waste conversion  
- Government & industry partnerships to expand **Waste to Wealth** initiatives
