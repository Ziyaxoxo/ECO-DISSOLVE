## 🚀 Overview  
ECO-DISSOLVE is a **Waste to Wealth innovation** that goes beyond traditional recycling. Instead of simply reshaping plastics, our solution **chemically dissolves plastic waste into harmless compounds and reusable resources**, permanently removing it from the waste loop while creating new value streams.  

---

## 🌱 Problem Statement  
India generates **1.7 lakh tonnes of municipal solid waste daily**, with only **54% scientifically treated**. The rest ends up in landfills, oceans, or open burning — causing pollution, greenhouse gases, and massive resource losses.

## 💡 Our Solution – Turning Waste into Wealth  
- **Innovative chemical dissolution** using eco-friendly solvents  
- **High-value by-products** recovered for renewable applications  
- **Permanent elimination** of harmful plastic waste  
- **Circular economy approach** to transform waste into usable wealth  

---

## ⚙️ How It Works  
1. **Collection & Sorting** – Waste streams gathered and pre-sorted  
2. **Dissolution Bath** – Application of ECO-DISSOLVE solution at room temperature  
3. **Decomposition** – Plastics broken down at the molecular level  
4. **Resource Recovery** – Safe by-products reused as raw material for industry
